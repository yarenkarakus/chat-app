In this application, you can get together with friends and communicate.

### if you want to get more information, [click!](https://firebase.google.com/docs?authuser=0&hl=en)

## I used:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing
- [uuid]()
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication, storage and database

## Usage

### Credentials

Go to project root directory and run:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

This will create an `.env` file with needed fields in root directory.

You need one thing for this project to work:

- A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) web project and your Firebase config credentials.

Once you get your credentials, open .env file and fill the related variables with your own credentials.

### Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

### Run React dev server

```
yarn dev
```

### To build for production

```
yarn build
```
